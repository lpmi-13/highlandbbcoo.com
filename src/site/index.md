## The Highland BBCoo

We were discussing what sort of highland barbeque we could have, and that's when we hit on the idea of a highlandbbcoo. In particular, we thought we could get some free beer from a local brewery and then put their logo on this page. That was at least 50% of the motivation.

At this point, we may or may not plan to have the event be annual, but we can discuss at the very first annual Highland BBCoo.

This site is made with Eleventy, which will make it easy to add additional pages per event, with photos and all that jazz.
